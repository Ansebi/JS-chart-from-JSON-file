# Passing-variables-between-Python-and-JS
This illustrates a learning process for a JavaScript beginner from JS level zero to an animated html chart fed by the data generated in a primitive Python backend.
The important thing is that the data must be passed in real time from Python to JS and commands must be sent back from JS to Python. The transition is achieved by reading/writing JSON files at both ends.

NOTE: to make html read local files
(which is necessary in this project),
Python server_with_header.py must run on the computer.
Which in its turn requires Python to be installed.
